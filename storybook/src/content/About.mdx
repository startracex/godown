# About this package

## Creation Background

This library was created when I first started learning front-end development.

At the beginning, it only contained CSS. When I got to know JavaScript, I converted
it into a JavaScript library.

## Referenced Libraries

This component library refers to several (popular in the market) component
libraries, include following (listed in alphabetical order, no closed source libraries are displayed):

- `ant-design`
- `semantic-ui`
- `fluentui`
- `heroui (pervious nextui)`
- `shadcn/ui`

## Logo Situation

Since I don't know how to make a logo, this library still doesn't have a
suitable logo even though it has been released for two years.

Recently, I added a new logo (which I made casually, inspired by `National Geographic`), and you can check it below.

There are no restrictions on the use of the logo of this library.
